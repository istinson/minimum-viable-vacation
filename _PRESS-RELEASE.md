There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Minimum Viable Vacation

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  Find a trip that fits with your budget
## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  Given your budget and trip dates, we combine cheap flights and cheap hotel prices to find destinations for you to travel to. Our goal is to find the trips that you might not think you can afford, but you actually can.
## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Solves the problem of people not being aware that they can travel to a lot of countries. For example, flights might be cheap to country A but hotel prices are super expensive. Country B that has higher flight prices may have cheaper hotel prices.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  This product finds the cheap destinations that may be overlooked because of initial high flight prices, but has super cheap hotel prices.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "I got this idea because I was always broke but wanted to travel. From my experiences of looking up flight and hotel prices, it dawned on me that things are not as they appear; some places might be super cheap even if flights are more expensive."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Just enter your budget and select your dates, and MVV will list your potential future vacations.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "This is awesome. I love this product because it helped me realize that a trip to Thailand is cheaper than Hawaii, even tho the flights were more expensive!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  Go and check out Minimum Viable Vacation yourself! In a month you may find yourself in paradise!
